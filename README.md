This repository contains a simple scaffolded Arcade project.

## Setup

Create a virtual environment and install the project requirements.
The project depends on `arcade>=2.6,<2.7`, so make sure this
version is installed. If you have previously installed dependencies,
run the install command again to ensure the correct version of Arcade
is used:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use "venv\Scripts\activate"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

Activate your virtual environment if needed and run `python src/main.py`.
